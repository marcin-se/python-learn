        <h2>About me...</h2>
        <p>This project was created on the Python engine,
            fueled with the Flask framework, by a still not very
            qualified specialist...<br/>
            But that will change soon...<br/>
            I think so...<br/>
            This is a final work on the module that taught how to use
            the "Flask" and "Jinja" frameworks.<br/>
            I think that everything worked out - the script works!<br/><br/>
            In addition, this page will be a portfolio about anything that can
            be put in a portfolio :)</p>
